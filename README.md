At a given location, the post-industrial time is:

DAYTIME
If daytime at location,
  i.e. the sun is up / above the horizon.
  i.e. the most recent event was a sunrise rather than a sunset,
  then the post-industrial time is
  Sunrise + hh:mm:ss
  Where the sunrise is the most recent sunrise at that location.
  The total day length should also be included for the current period of daylight.
  
NIGHTIME
If nighttime at location,
  i.e. the sun is down / below the horizon.
  i.e. the most recent event was a sunset rather than a sunrise,
  then the post-industrial time is
  Sunrise - hh:mm:ss
  Where the sunrise referenced is the NEXT sunrise to occur at that location, and the amount of time is the amount of time until 
  that event. The total night length should also be included for the current period of nighttime.
  
THE POLAR REGIONS
The issue arises in the polar regions where the sun does not set on a particular industrial calendar date / rotation of the earth.
When this is the case,
The post-industrial time continues to count up since the sun last rose above the horizon, and the day length is 
the total time until the sun sets. Near the poles, the sun may remain above the horizon for months at a time. This means 
that the post-industrial time at this location WOULD reach over 4,000 hours. Half of a year is 4,380 hours. In the polar regions,
when the day length exceeds 24 hours, the unit rotations must be introduced and the post-industrial time becomes:
Sunrise + rr:hh:mm:ss
This is required in order for the post-industrial time to continue to have meaning with respect to where the sun is in the sky.
In the arctic region, the most recent sunset will have been in the south, and therefore the rr value will change over when the
sun crosses south. As the sun circles around just above the horizon,
The sun will be in the west at about xx:06:xx:xx, north at ~xx:12:xx:xx, east at ~xx:18:xx:xx, cross south again at ~xx:00:xx:xx
for the entire duration of a multiple rotation day.
Day length [should be?] within a few minutes of when the rr value changes over and day lengths will be within
a few minutes of multiples of 24 hour periods.
  this is relative to the sun. (Not relative to the stars, don't try to get clever and use a "sidereal day" for the number of
  rotations. The rotations are relative to the sun.)
